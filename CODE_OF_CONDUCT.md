# Fest Registration Website Project Code of Conduct

## Welcome

Welcome to the **Fest Registration Website** repository! This project is a web application designed to simplify the process of registering for events and festivals. The application provides an intuitive interface for users to register for different events, manage their registrations, and receive updates about upcoming events. We are committed to maintaining a positive, inclusive, and harassment-free environment for everyone involved.

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward others
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Apologizing when mistakes are made, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best for the community

Unacceptable behavior includes:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Harassment in any form, including public or private harassment
- Publishing othersâ€™ private information without explicit permission
- Any other conduct which would reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
